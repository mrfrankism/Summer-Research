# Summer-Research 2017

This was the start of some summer reasearch I participated at WPI.
We needed a really fast ADC to sample E-Fields around a phantom head to then back 
calculate where the applied magnetic field affected the head. When the summer ended we were working on the circuitry
and antenna to properly measure the E-field.

This code was written for Arduino, which is very C-based

## WPI Summer Research 2017

This was the start of some summer reasearch I participated at WPI.
We needed a really fast ADC to sample E-Fields around a phantom head to then back 
calculate where the applied magnetic field affected the head. The ADC speed changing code was written in Arduino which is very C based.

Apart from the fast ADC, the signal needs to be free of noise, so when the summer ended we were working on the circuitry
and antenna to properly measure the E-field. That is the Small Antenna V1-2 Files
